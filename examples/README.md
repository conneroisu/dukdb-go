## üõ† Development Tips

### Environment Setup

Each example works with the Nix development environment:

```bash
# Enter development shell
nix develop

# All dependencies and DuckDB are available
go run examples/basic/main.go
```

### Testing Patterns

All examples follow consistent testing patterns:

- Comprehensive test coverage
- Error handling validation
- Performance benchmarks where applicable
- Skip tests gracefully if DuckDB unavailable

### Code Organization

Examples demonstrate best practices:

- Proper resource cleanup (`defer` statements)
- Error handling at each step
- Transaction management
- Connection pooling considerations

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Connection Errors**

   - Ensure DuckDB library is available
   - Use `nix develop` for automatic setup
   - Check `DUCKDB_LIB_DIR` environment variable

1. **Test Skipping**

   - Tests gracefully skip if DuckDB unavailable
   - This is expected behavior in CI environments
   - All tests pass when DuckDB is properly configured

1. **Performance Variations**

   - Performance results vary by system
   - Use benchmarks for relative comparisons
   - Consider system load and available resources
